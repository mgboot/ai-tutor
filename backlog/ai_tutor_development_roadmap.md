# AI Tutor Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Framework (MVP) ✅

- [x] Create multi-agent tutoring system with specialized agents:
  - [x] Quiz Creator: Generates assessments to evaluate student understanding
  - [x] Evaluator: Analyzes student responses to identify knowledge gaps
  - [x] Info Reviewer: Provides targeted educational materials based on gaps
- [x] Implement agent collaboration flow for adaptive learning cycle
- [x] Develop core conversation flow (assessment → student response → evaluation → materials → follow-up)

## Phase 2: Knowledge Integration (Current Sprint)

- [ ] Knowledge base implementation
  - [ ] Select a simple initial textbook (English, History, Anthropology, Social Sciences)
  - [ ] Create PDF ingestion pipeline to Azure AI Search
  - [ ] Implement chunking, embeddings, and search configuration
  - [ ] Perform indexing and verify retrieval quality
- [ ] Citation system
  - [ ] Link generated content back to source materials
  - [ ] Support references to specific pages/sections in source materials
  - [ ] Add capability to show source chunks as images when needed

## Phase 3: Enhanced Assessment

- [ ] Dynamic quiz generation
  - [ ] Develop system to create quizzes tailored to specific chapters/topics
  - [ ] Implement difficulty scaling based on student performance
  - [ ] Create question templates for different learning objectives
- [ ] Improved gap identification
  - [ ] Add pattern recognition for recurring mistakes
  - [ ] Implement categorical knowledge gap classification
  - [ ] Create visualization of student knowledge map

## Phase 4: Expanded Learning Resources

- [ ] Multi-format learning materials
  - [ ] Support text-based explanations with varying complexity levels
  - [ ] Generate diagrams and visual representations (descriptions)
  - [ ] Provide alternative explanations using different approaches
- [ ] External resource integration
  - [ ] Add capability to recommend external videos/articles
  - [ ] Link to supplementary textbook sections from different sources

## Phase 5: Usability & Flexibility

- [ ] Content flexibility
  - [ ] Implement "Bring Your Own PDF" functionality
  - [ ] Support complex books with technical content
  - [ ] Handle mathematics, circuit diagrams, and complex formulas
- [ ] User experience enhancements
  - [ ] Create simple web interface
  - [ ] Add session persistence and history
  - [ ] Implement progress tracking

## Implementation Priorities

### Priority 1 (Must Have)

- [ ] PDF ingestion pipeline to Azure AI Search

- [ ] Multi-format learning resources
- [ ] Progress tracking system

### Priority 3 (Could Have)

- [ ] External resource integration
- [ ] Web-based user interface
- [ ] Session persistence

### Priority 4 (Would Like)

- [ ] Bring Your Own PDF functionality
- [ ] Advanced analytics on student performance
- [ ] Multi-user support
