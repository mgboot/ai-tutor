# To-Do List

## Must

TODO Pick a book that is very simple (English, History, Anthropology, Social Sciences)
TODO Place a pdf ingestion python notebook for the data ingestion flow into Azure AI Search (cracking, chunking, creating the embeddings, creating the search configs, perform the indexing)
TODO Refer the student back to where they can find the correct answer (citations, blob storage images of the chunks (image URL))
TODO Create an Agent determines if additional support is needed.
TODO Ability to create Dynamic Quizzes based on the lesson

• At some chapter in the book the AI Tutor (Quiz Creator) will create a test to see if they understand the concepts and can do exercises commensurate with what they have been studying.
• The AI tutor (evaluator) notices after several questions that the student seems to always get stuck on parts that involve capacitors.  They understand resistors, transistors, etc. really well, but get the final answer wrong based on this lack of knowledge in a base skill like capacitors.  
• The AI Tutor (Info Reviewer) presents the student with a couple chapters or paragraphs explaining capacitors again, or from a different text book (or online video).
• The AI Tutor (Quiz Creator) then builds new test to see if the student now has a solid understanding of capacitors and will not be "left behind without a base understanding" as the class moves on.  

## Should

TODO Azure AI Search, Extract and Index: Use the complex books (Circuits, Math, Geometry, Complex Graphs and formulas)

## Could

## Would

TODO Ability to bring your own PDF
